# how to setup the directory properly? 




# for this project we will need the following directories (based on the project requirements):
# app_data that will consist of the log file
# issues directory that holds all the issues we get stuck upon during development
# src should consist of the following sub-directories:
## configs that holds Config.php on how to run the program and CreateDB.php file to set up the database
## controllers that will hold all the controllers (probably, going to be just one)
## js that contains given spreadsheet.js file
## models - probably, will consist of two models since our MySQL consists of two tables: sheet and sheet_code
## views - should be three of them: landing page, edit spreadsheet, view spreadsheet
